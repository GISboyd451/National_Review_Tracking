# National_Review_Tracking
Used in the monthly national QAQC process.

## Overview
The SPRINT team performs their own QAQC/analysis on top of the monthly replication and the national qc process. We do this in order to track ongoing issues, help states implement datasets into their stateâ€™s sde, perform analysis, and document changes over time. The National_Review_Tracking script will compile all reports generated from the National QC process and then output a master log/change excel file.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7+, 3.4+ 
* Works on Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX.

#### Packages Needed
- os (default)
- time (default)
- glob (default)
- sys (default)
- datetime (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- numpy (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- calendar (https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html)
- shutil (https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html)
- openpyxl (https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/)

## Documentation
This script currently operates off of several report tables (excel, csv, etc.) to retrieve the monthly QAQC report numbers and stats to be formatted/appened into the 'National_Review_Tracking.xlsx'. The 'National_Review_Tracking.xlsx' will contain the quality numbers and the percent change over time, going back to the year 2017. *Note: Changes will be monthly.

EXCEL CURRENT SETUP

Info1 | Info2 | Info3 | Info4 | 
------------ | -------------|-------------|-------------|
Text Field | Text Field | Text Field | Text Field | 

- Info1 = State ADMIN CODE 
- Info2 = Dataset 
- Info3 = Attribute Name
- Info4 = Feature Class 

*Monthly change values will be to the right of the above constants.These values include:

- Pass Counts = How many records are passing quality control
- Total Counts = Total number of records
- Accuracy % = Percent of records passing
- Percent Change = Percent Accuracy change from previous month

## Running The Script
Update the global paths:

qc_output_root = r'\\blm\\dfs\\loc\\EGIS\\ProjectsNational\\NationalDataQuality\\Sprint\\analysis_tools\\National_Review'
qc_reports_root = r'\\blm\\dfs\\loc\\EGIS\\ProjectsNational\\NationalDataQuality\\Sprint\\Reports'
backup = r'\\blm\\dfs\\loc\\EGIS\\ProjectsNational\\NationalDataQuality\\Sprint\\analysis_tools\\National_Review\\raw\\Nat_review_backups' #location of backups
national_xlsx = r'\\blm\\dfs\\loc\\EGIS\\ProjectsNational\\NationalDataQuality\\Sprint\\analysis_tools\\National_Review\\National_Review_Tracking.xlsx'

Then verify that qc_reports_root contains QC reports and the national_xlsx exists. Then run script.
